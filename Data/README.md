This folder contains all of the data releases and derived data. 
Each folder is named with the sample name (Discovery, Failed, Validation, or Full) and the release date.

These data should not be changed once being committed.  Any additional derived data should be placed in the appropriate
directory underneath the Derived_data folder.
